## Dolly 15k
Databricks-dolly-15k is an open source dataset of instruction-following records generated by thousands of Databricks 
employees in several of the behavioral categories outlined in the InstructGPT paper, 
including brainstorming, classification, closed QA, generation, information extraction, open QA, and summarization.
## Bitsandbytes
The bitsandbytes is a lightweight wrapper around CUDA custom functions, 
in particular 8-bit optimizers, matrix multiplication (LLM.int8()), and quantization functions.
## QLoRA
It is an efficient finetuning approach that reduces memory usage enough to finetune a 65B parameter model on a single 
48GB GPU while preserving full 16-bit finetuning task performance. QLoRA backpropagates gradients through a frozen, 
4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank Adapters (LoRA).
