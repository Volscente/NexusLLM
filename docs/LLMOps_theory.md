# GenAI Development
## Lifecycle
- **Discovery** - Explore landscape of available models to identify the most suitable one for their specific gen AI
application.
- **Development and Experimentation** - Techniques like prompt engineering, few-shot learning or PEFT.
- **Deployment** - It needs many new artifacts in the deployment process, including
prompt templates, chain definitions, embedding models, retrieval data stores, and fine-tuned
model adapters among others.
- **Continuous Monitoring**
- **Continuous Improvement** - It requires taking foundation models (FMs) and then adapting them to our specific use case.
Traditional continuous training still holds relevance for scenarios when recurrent 
fine-tuning or incorporating human feedback loops are still needed.
